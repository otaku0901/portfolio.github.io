<center><h1>Hi, I'm Shreya</h1></center><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
This is my portfolio.&nbsp&nbspI have used html and css to code this website.&nbspThough I have experience in coding, it was only limited to back end coding.&nbsp&nbsp
I did learn <q> HTML </q> basics when I was in 7th grade but never gave much thought about it until recently.&nbsp&nbsp It is really interesting now that I try to do it
with more understanding than I ever had as a 7th grader.&nbspI pray that I can create more complex sites in future.
